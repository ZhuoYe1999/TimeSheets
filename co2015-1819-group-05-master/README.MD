## Important note:

As this is an internal company app, a user needs to be added by admin to be able to sign up - otherwise the app will not work properly. There are two ways of doing this:

1. Using the database currently connected in the project - > there is an admin already created, that is permanently in the
database with username: "a.admin@fdmgroup.com" and password: "password", using that account you can login to admin page, add
other users and then sign them up

2. Otherwise you need to add an admin account in the database that you are using. It is possible to do that through the 
application: go to "/adminmain/" there you can add users

</br>

### Keep in mind 
1. All usernames must be in the form "name.surname@fdmgroup.com" - attempting to use other usernames will not be successful.

2. Any newly added user needs to sign up before logging in
