### First meeting - client questions:
_Note: optional questions are in italics._

1.	Are the timesheets accessed online or only on the company’s internal network?
2.	Do they have work emails/work id or some other unique identification?

    * a.	Are emails/UID connected to some database that has employment details e.g. position?

    * b.	(If they have work emails) Are employees allowed to use other emails for logging in?

3.	Does an employee have a permanently assigned line manager or does it depend on the shift/time of the week etc.?
4.	Are there physical card punch timesheets? Is there a database that we would need to cross reference? 
5.	Will the timesheet app be used to add employees to the database or is it added some other way and we just use the provided database? 
6.	Are there different shift patterns (night/part-time/nonstandard hours etc.)? 
7.	Are the default hours in a database for us to use? Or does the line manager have to fill them in our app?
8.	Do we want a history showing past submitted timesheets?
9.	Can the timesheet submission day be set in the app by admin or is it set by us permanently? _Are we ok with automatic submission?_

    * a.	If by us, then what day will it be? And what time are the notifications/reminders going out to the employees?
 
    * b.	If by us, what if the submission day is a bank holiday? Does it just move to the previous day?
 
10.	What happens to rejected timesheets? Are they sent back to the employee or does the line manager correct them? Or do we include both options?

    * _a. What if an employee realises they made a mistake right after they submitted? Is there an option to resubmit? If so, how many times? What happens to the previous submissions on the line manager’s end?_

11.	Are overtime hours worked above standard working week hours or are they hours worked outside of business times (i.e. afternoons, Sundays, holidays etc.)?

    * _a.	Is there maximum overtime?_

12.	_Can some employees have a flexible work week where they just have an amount of time that they have to put in but no strict schedule?_
